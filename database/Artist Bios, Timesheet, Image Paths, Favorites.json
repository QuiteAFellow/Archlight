    "Description": "GWAR is a thrash metal band that was founded in Richmond, Virginia in 1984. The band has an elaborate mythology involving the members being interplanetary warriors who came to Earth to enslave and brutally slaughter the human race. Over its decades of existence, GWAR has seen a rotating lineup of musicians and other artists who are all known as Slave Pit Inc. The members of the band perform under various aliases that are led by Blöthar the Berserker (their vocalist Michael Bishop). Each member has outlandish costumes that are often incorporated into their lively stage shows that include fake rituals with various corpses spraying the crowd with washable blood, piss, and other bodily fluids. Within the culture of the fanbase is the need to be covered in blood, so fans will crowd the rail wearing all white as an offering to GWAR at each performance.",

During the trip, a local girl caught feelings for Amber but was heartbroken when the girl learned Amber was a girl as well. The cottage where this all happened was called the Japanese House and was owned by actress Kate Winslet. The music of The Japanese House echoes this experience with its androgynous presentation of dream pop. Amber signed with Dirty HIts Records in 2015 and proceeded to release singles and EPs until her full album Good at Falling arrived in 2019. This album achieved critical success, reaching number 64 on the U.K. charts, and was followed up with her EP Chewing Cotton Wool in 2020. After a three-year hiatus, Amber came back with a single “Boyhood” in 2023.",

Growing up, he was inspired by YouTube videos of Eddie Van Halen’s six-string techniques and local traditional Tuareg melodies. Mdou mastered the guitar by building one himself to craft his own style of rock, now dubbed Saharan rock. He then wrote, produced, and starred in the first Tuareg language film Akounak Tedalat Taha Tazoughai, a Purple Rain remake that translates to “Rain The Color Of Blue With A Little Red In It.” Mdou’s music traveled across West Africa via mobile phone data cards, which is a popular form of music distribution in the region. His popularity got him DIY world tours and album releases via the indie label Sahel Sounds, growing his audience to the global scale. He formed a full band, consisting of a local rhythm guitarist, local drummer, and bassist Mikey Coltun who files 20 hours from Brooklyn and takes a 28-hour bus ride to reach Agadez for band practice and recording. Mikey also serves as the band’s producer and road manager, having played over 500 shows on three continents with the band. In the fall of 2023, Mdou Moctar and his band were stranded in the US after a coup in Niger prevented them from flying back to their home country after a tour. They launched a GoFundMe to raise funds to stay in the US until they could once again travel home. The band is still in the US as the crisis in Niger continues.",

    "Description": "Rebecca and Megan Lovell of Larkin Poe, who nabbed the Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Album earlier this month with “Blood Harmony.” Planet Rock Magazine called them “bewitching Southern gothic darkness,” and I couldn’t have put it better myself. Born and bred in the Deep South, the Lovells have planted roots in Georgia and Tennessee, and the cultural sounds and soul have steeped their art not unlike classic southern iced tea — but with a bite. Before Larkin Poe, there was the bluegrass/Americana Lovell Sisters, including their third sister, Jessica. The Lovell Sisters officially began in 2005, before any of the sisters even entered their twenties. You might wonder how two of those Lovell sisters created a rock group of a different name completely sans Lovell, but they still kept it in the family because Larkin Poe happens to be their great-great-great-grandfather. If you’re questioning if there’s any relation to that other Poe guy famous for spooky vibes and short stories, he was in fact a distant cousin. Between seven studio albums and eight Eps, Larkin Poe has a wide discography in their arsenal. They can also claim appearances in work from legends like Elvis Costello, Steven Tyler and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.",

    "Description": "Knock2, aka Richard Kahonethap, is a bass house DJ who came into the EDM scene in 2022. The previous year he released his now iconic bass house anthem “dashstar*” without any playlisting. This single exploded into millions of plays when major players including DJ Snake, Tiesto, and Joyryde got it to the 3rd slot on the 2023 EDCLV most-played list. Knock2 kept releasing other singles that garnered him millions of plays including “gettin’ hott” and PARANOiD,” which gave him a reputation for crafting a classic sound that EDM fans craved. In 2022, Knock2 debuted his headline show experience “Room202” at sold-out Los Angeles shows. These shows were conceptual warehouse sets that focused on having massive party energy instead of high production as seen in most EDM sets today. When Knock2 took his “Room202” show to San Francisco and Salt Lake City, the shows sold out in minutes. He then went to Japan to play three sold-out shows. After releasing his 2023 EP “Room 202,” Knock2 took “Room202” across the U.S. for his first debut headline tour, selling out all nine shows instantly. This led to venue upgrades and an additional four dates added to the tour. In 2023, he made his festival debut at Coachella and HITC NYC. Later that year, he made his first headline slot at Imagine Music Festival doing a b2b with the one and only Dillon Francis. His debut album NOLIMIT is slated to be released in 2024.",

Sholler shifted more focus to Whyte Fang after releasing the Alison album, Loner, in 2022. Whyte Fang’s latest work, Genesis, opens with a disembodied computer voice sharing, “I’m going to be taking you away from here for a while…” before transporting listeners to a journey accompanied by an array of vocal collaborators.
