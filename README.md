## Why?

Why create your own app if Bonnaroo has an official one already?

Two reasons.

1. The official app has some recorded security issues. One user has mentioned that someone was able to access and install malicious software through a bluetooth connection, causing them to have to wipe their phone to resolve the issue. This is extremely dangerous situation someplace where communication is critical, such as a multi-day music festival.
2. There are major design fundamentals with the official app that I didn't agree with. For instance, to access the map on the app, you have to travel to a webpage. With mobile data not being a guarantee on the farm, I wanted the map as well as everything else with the app to be completely operational without mobile data access. This was the #1 priority when developing the app. This was also an opportunity to build in some additional features I determined to be valuable, such as Artist Biographies, the ability to add pins to the maps, etc.
