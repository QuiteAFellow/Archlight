## Why?

Why create your own app if Bonnaroo has an official one already?

Two reasons.

1. The official app has some recorded security issues. One user has mentioned that someone was able to access and install malicious software through bluetooth, causing them to have to wipe their phone.
2. There are major design fundamentals that I didn't agree with. For instance, to access the map on the app, you have to travel to a webpage. With mobile data not being a guarantee on the farm, I wanted the map as well as everything else with the app to be completely operational without mobile data access. This was the #1 priority when developing the app. This was also an opportunity to build in some additional features I determined to be valuable.
